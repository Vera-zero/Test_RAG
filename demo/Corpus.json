    "context": "Duncan was first elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly in the 1996 general election . Duncan was elected as a Liberal to represent the Porter Creek South riding , a riding located in Whitehorse . In the 1996 general election , Piers McDonald ( New Democratic Party ) won a majority government . Duncan was one of three Liberals elected . Liberal leader at the time , Ken Taylor , was unsuccessful in winning his Mount Lorne riding . In 1998 , Duncan was elected leader of the Yukon Liberal Party . From 1998-2000 , Duncan served as the Leader of the Official Opposition in the legislature . In the 2000 general election Duncan led the Yukon Liberal Party to a majority government , defeating New Democratic incumbent Piers McDonald . The Liberals were elected in 10 ridings and received 42.7% of the popular vote . Early in 2002 , the Liberal majority was reduced to a minority after the defection of three Liberal MLAs , Mike McLarnon , Don Roberts and Wayne Jim . The catalyst for the defections was reported to be Duncans allegedly heavy-handed and secretive leadership style . On October 4 , 2002 , only two years into Duncans five-year term , she called a general election for November 4 , 2002 . The rationale for the election was to achieve certainty in the legislature , however many Yukoners were angered at the quick election . The Yukon Liberals were reduced to only one seat after the election - Duncans own riding of Porter Creek South . Yukon Party leader Dennis Fentie , a former NDP MLA , lead his new party to victory . The Liberals were reduced to third party status with Duncan as the sole Liberal MLA . At the 2005 Yukon Liberal Party leadership convention , Duncan was defeated by Arthur Mitchell by a margin of 357 votes to 303 . Citing health concerns , she did not seek re-election in the 2006 general election ."
